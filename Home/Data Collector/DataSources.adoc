= Data sources 

== processing
The collector operates on data sources. This means they are all constructed in the same manner.
The collection of the raw data is done depending on where it comes from,
but the one thing constant in all collection points is that as close to interrupt as possible the time stamp needs to be updated.
After the data is collected from the source it goes through a processing block. These are defined using a interface. 
This means all all the collector has to do is to use the interface which decouples the collecting and processing from the message construction logic. 

== Post processing
After the data is processed a object implementing the logable interface is declared valid by the processing.
This valid object can then be turned in to a string representation and be placed in to the message buffer to be transmitted to the logging system and Transmission unit.
