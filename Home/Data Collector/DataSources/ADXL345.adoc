= ADXL345 

The ADXL345 is used to collect acceleration data from the vehicle and needs to be mounted in a way that all that's measured is the vehicles acceleration.
The driver uses 4 wire SPI. This is combined with a interrupt line, power and ground makes it a 7 wire cable.

The driver is configured using hardcoded binary numbers these would need some refactoring to allow the use of the Config.hpp to configure the accelerometers' data rate.

settings:
- Output data rate: 100 hz 
- measurement mode: true
- dataready interrupt
- interrupts on pin: int0
- fullres 
- 16g range
