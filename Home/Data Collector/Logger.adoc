= Logger

The Logger class functions as a simple wrapper around the STM32 HAL. 
This is because closing and opening a new file took too long (\~15ms).

It has a number of methods which write data to the Openlog.
These take either Strings, raw bytes, or any object conforming to the Iloggable interface
