= Common protocol specification
Sjoerd van de Wege <s.vandewege@student.han.nl>

This document contains the common parts of the Protocol specification from the collection unit to the transmission unit and to the Logger.
As well as the Protocol used by the GPS system built by Remko Welling.

The data transmitted from the Data Collection unit are based on RFC 4180 but not conform to the specification.
To be conform there would need to be an equal amount of fields on each line and lines should be ended with `CRLF`

== Logging protocol info 

The data that's logged to file post fixed with a `\n` character to place all data on their own line.
This allows the data to be stored as it came into the system. 
This result in the following format: `[Timestamp][Data]\n`
Where Timestamp and Data are filled in by the collector

== ESP protocol info
The data going to the ESP from data collection system is surrounded by a start and a stop character, 0x01 and 0x18 respectively.
For verification of the data integrity a 16 bit CRC is used. 
If the start or stop character appears in the CRC there is an escape character (0x10) added.
This result in the following format: `[START_BYTE][Timestamp][Data][CRC_HIGH][CRC_LOW][STOP_BYTE]`
Where Timestamp and Data are filled in by the collector

Assuming an object implementing `ILoggable` has a sample time of `23:17:42.099` and data of x: `-109` y: `32` z: `-229`  and a ID of: `ACC`

.Example ESP Protocol message

Byte Stream: 0x01 '2' '3' ':' '1' '7' ':' '4' '2' ',' '0' '9' '9' | 'A' 'C' 'C' ',' '-' '1' '0' '9' ',' '3' '2' ',' '-' '2' '2' '9' 0xD0 0x32 0x18
Interpretation: [START][Timestamp String][Data String][CRC_H][CRC_L][STOP]

== GPS Time Info

The information from the GNSS unit is send to the collection unit with a variable length frame.

NOTE: The CRC length is variable from 2 up to 4 bytes for escaping the start, stop and escape character.

The following image shows the data send by the GNSS unit in bytes

== Configuration
The Protocol uses compile-time constants defined in `Config/Config.hpp` to determine the start, stop and escape characters .
*   `Config::GNSS::START_BYTE`: The start delimiter byte for UART transmissions.
*   `Config::GNSS::STOP_BYTE`: The stop delimiter byte for UART transmissions.
