= Data Reception

After the data is collected and sent via the MiFi to the MQTT broker, it is time to process the data.

The protocol used for data transmission is documented in the "Protocol Specification" document, located link:Home/Data%20Transmission/Protocol%20Specification[].
This document provides detailed information about the data format and transmission method.


The Data Reception unit also has a configuration file, which contains the specifications.
