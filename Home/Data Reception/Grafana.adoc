= Grafana

This project uses Grafana to visualize the vehicle data. The data is read from the MySQL database. In Grafana, there are two visualizations developed: one for showing historical data and one for showing incoming data. The main goal of these visualizations is to aid the powertrain in making the racecar as efficient as possible.
