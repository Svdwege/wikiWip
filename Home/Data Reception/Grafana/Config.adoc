= Configuration of Grafana

In this section of the wiki, can you find the information about the structure of Grafana, How to configure data sources and how to add users.


== General structure of Grafana

In Grafana is it possible to create multiple organisations within one instance.

The default organisation is `Main Org.`. Unconfigured users have acces to this one, and in the current structure is *this organisation NOT used*

As shown in Figure 1, there is another organisation, named `Hydromotive`. This is organisation that has been used to create the visualization infrastructure.
Before creating visualization or datastructure, make sure that your on this organisation.

Under the tab (left side of screen) _Dashboards_ is there an folder created named _Hydromotive_. Under this folder you can find all the visualizations.

NOTE: When new visualization are created, they should be placed in this folder, unless they are not for Hydromotive.


== Users

Grafana has a user administration structure that might remind you of Linux filesystems. The superuser of Grafana is "admin" and should not be used for visualization development. It acts similarly to using root on a Linux system. The "admin" user has all the rights and is the only user that can change or add new data sources.


=== Creating New Users
