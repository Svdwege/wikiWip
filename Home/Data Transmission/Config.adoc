= Configuration of ESP32-S3

In this section of the Wiki will discuss the configuration of the ESP32-S3 in terms of hardware and software.

Here will also discuss on how to set up the software for the first time


== Hardware configuration

First lets start with the pins that are used on the ESP32-S3.
