= Data Flow within Data Transmission Unit

This section of the wiki page explains the data flow within the Data Transmission Unit.

The data comes in from the UART from the Data Collection Unit.

    UART[Incoming data] --> capture[Capturing data]
    capture --> crc[CRC validation]

    crc --> |Valid| process[Data processing]
    crc --> |Invalid| stop[Wait for new data]

    process --> tokenize_storage[Tokenization and Storage]

In parallel with the data collection within this unit, there is also a timer running that publishes data every second. It publishes data even if no new data has been captured.
