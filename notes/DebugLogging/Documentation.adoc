= Debug logging
the code in TinyPrintf.cpp and the corresponding header was adapted to c++ from http://www.sparetimelabs.com/tinyprintf/tinyprintf.php[here] 

the ITM sending logic and function was adapted from the internet however the source was lost but the code is similar to the function found in core_cm3.h of the CMSIS

The libary uses multiple logging levels which are the following the level number and the channel number are the same
These do need to be reordened as the trace should be below info and debug

- level 0:Test
- level 1:Error
- level 2:Warn
- level 3:Trace
- level 4:Info
- level 5:Debug
